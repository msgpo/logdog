Introduction
-------------------------------------

logdog is a desktop Java program that presents data from Android's
logging framework 'logcat' as graphs. The user defines regular
expressions to match desired log lines. The regexps can contain regexp
groups that defines the values to be plotted on the y-axis. The actual
value from a group is parsed as an integer, float or a hex value. The
x-axis is always the time.

For instance, the regexp below matches log lines that start with any
text followed by a V (for verbose) and the log tag "Preeffect:". The
text " EFFECT_CMD_SET_VOLUME vol = " is then matched exactly followed
by a regexp group (enclosed in ()) until the end of line ($). Since
the regexp group starts with 0x the value is assumed to be
hexadecimal. The actual value (matched by ".*?") is parsed by logdog
and plotted.

.* V Preeffect: EFFECT_CMD_SET_VOLUME vol = (0x.*?)$

You should be able to compile and run logdog on all platforms
supported by Java but it has only been tested on Ubuntu.

Prerequisites
-------------------------------------

Eclipse
Java SE 1.7 JRE

If building and running outside of Eclipse:
bash
ant


-------------------------------------
Runnning logdog from within Eclipse
-------------------------------------

<root> below is the logdog git directory.

 1. Select 'File / New / Java Project' from the menu.
 2. Enter a project name (logdog).
 3. Uncheck 'Use default location' and browse to <root>/logdog.
 4. Ensure that at least a Java 1.6 JRE is selected at 'Use an execution environment JRE'.
 5. Click Next.
 6. Select the Libraries tab and click "Add External JARs".
 7. Browse to <root>/jfreechart-1.0.19/lib and select these jars:
    hamcrest-core-1.3.jar, jcommon-1.0.23.jar, jfreechart-1.0.19.jar and junit-4.11.jar.
    Press Ctrl when selecting each file. Click OK.
 8. Click Finish.
 9. If you get errors for methods with the @Override annotation you need to do this:
    a. Select 'Window / Preferences' from the menu.
    b. Goto 'Java / Compiler' and change 'Compiler compliance level' to at least 1.6.
10. Right-click the logdog node in Package Explorer and select "Run As / Java Application".
11. Select logdog from the list and click OK.


-------------------------------------
Running logdog from the command-line
-------------------------------------

You must first create a jar-file in <root>/lib. This can be done in two ways.

A: From the command-line (requires bash and ant):
$ <root>/bin/build

B: From Eclipse:
1. Rightclick 'logdog' in Eclipse and select 'Export...'.
2. Select 'Runnable JAR File', click Next.
3. Select a logdog 'Launch configuration'.
4. At 'Export destination' enter <root>/lib/logdog.jar.
5. Click 'Finish'. You might get a few warnings, ignore them.

In both cases the resulting jar-file will be in <root>/lib

Then run logdog from the command-line by issuing:
$ <root>/bin/logdog
